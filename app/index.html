    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>GAME PERIOD: </strong>
            The Game begins at 12:00 AM Eastern Time (“ET”) on September 15, 2016 and ends at 11:59:59 PM ET on October 19, 2016 (“Game Period”). The
            Administrator’s computer is the Game’s official clock.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p><strong>ELIGIBILITY: </strong>
                The Game is offered only to legal residents of the fifty (50) United States and the District of Columbia who are at least 18 years of age at the time
                of entry. Employees, officers, directors, representatives, and agents of Sponsors, Administrator, and each of their respective parent companies,

            <p>
                Participation constitutes entrant’s full and unconditional agreement to these Official Rules and Sponsors’ and Administrator’s decisions, which are

                potential winners may be required to provide proof of identification and eligibility as required by Sponsors or Administrator. If it is discovered or
                suspected that an entrant has registered for or played or attempted to register for or play the Game using multiple e-mail addresses or multiple
                identities, all of that entrant’s entries will be declared null and void and any prize that entrant might have been entitled to receive or win will not
                be awarded. Use of any automated system or any like methods to participate in the Game is prohibited and will result in disqualification of any entrant
                attempting such use. If an entrant participates via a mobile device, message and data rates may apply for each text message sent and/or received. Not
                all cellular telephone providers carry the service necessary to participate in this Game through a mobile device. Entrants should check their mobile

                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p><strong>HOW TO PLAY THE GAME: </strong> During the Game Period, upon obtaining a Code or an Online Code, an entrant may play the Game using one (1) of the following two (2) methods (a “Game
                Play”):</p>

            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">

                <li>
                    <p><u><strong>Text Message: </strong></u>During the Game Period, an entrant must send a text message from his/her wireless mobile device to the short code 72823 (“Short Code”) with a valid
                        Code or Online Code. Message and data rates may apply to all messages sent and received. Your mobile carrier may put these charges on your mobile bill
                        or may deduct them from your prepaid account. An entrant will receive one (1) text message back for every message sent to the Short Code. For each text
                        message received with a valid Code or Online Code, subject to the limit of one (1) Game Play per entrant each day, an entrant will receive one (1) Game
                        Play. If it is the entrant’s first Game Play, the entrant will be sent a follow-up text message asking the entrant to confirm he/she is over 18 and
                        agrees to these Official Rules. An entrant must reply to this message confirming his/her age and agreement to the Official Rules to receive a Game
                        Play. Upon completion of a Game Play, the entrant will receive a notification text as to whether or not he/she is a potential winner (“Game
                        Notification”).</p>
                    <p>
                        IMPORTANT: An entrant may, at any time, choose to stop participating in this Game by sending an opt-out text message stating <strong>STOP </strong>to
                        the Short Code. If an entrant sends an opt- out text message, he/she will be sent a reply text message, which will provide that he/she has been
                        unsubscribed and will receive no further messages. If an entrant sends a text message stating <strong>HELP </strong>to the Short Code, he/she will be
                        sent a reply text message, which will include a link to these Official Rules. Each text message entry must be manually key-stroked/entered by the
                        entrant.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><u><strong>Online: </strong></u>An entrant may visit <a href="http://www.winpsvr.com/">www.winPSVR.com </a>(“Website”) during the Game Period and enter his/her valid e-mail address.
                        If it is the entrant’s first visit to the Website, then he/she must complete and submit the registration form by providing the requested information,
                        which will include but may not be limited to: complete first and last name (initials are not permitted),
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        telephone number, address (P.O. Boxes are not permitted), city, state and ZIP Code. The entrant then must enter a valid Code or Online Code and click
                        Submit to obtain a Game Play. Upon completion of the Game Play, the entrant will receive a Game Notification on the Website screen. Sponsors will also
                        notify the potential winners via e-mail using the e-mail addresses provided by the entrants during registration.</p>
                </li>

            </ol>
        </li>

        <p>Regardless of method of Game Play, each entrant who receives a “win” message will be deemed a potential winner pending confirmation and verification of
            the entrant’s eligibility and compliance with these Official Rules, as determined by Sponsors in their sole and absolute discretion. All potential
            winning Game Plays are subject to verification by Sponsor or Administrator, whose decisions are final and binding. An entrant is not a winner of any
            prize, even if the Game Play should so indicate, unless and until entrant’s eligibility and the potential winning Game Play have been verified and
            entrant has been notified that verification is complete. Sponsor will not accept screen shots or other evidence of winning in lieu of its validation
            process. Any Game Play that occurs after the system has failed for any reason is deemed a defective play, is void, and will not be honored.
        </p>
        <p>Except for the Online Code, each Code may only be used once. The Online Code is non-unique but may only be used once per entrant per day between 12:00
            AM ET on October 5, 2016 and 11:59:59 PM ET on October 19, 2016. <strong>Regardless of how many Codes are obtained by an entrant, the method used to acquire the Codes, or the method of Game Play, there is a limit of one (1) Game Play per entrant each day during the Game Period.
            </strong>A “day” is defined as starting at 12:00 AM ET and ending at 11:59:59 PM ET on a calendar day.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the event of a dispute as to the identity of an entrant, the Game Play will be declared made by the primary account holder of the account associated
            with the mobile device used to complete the Game Play, based on the applicable carrier’s records, or in the event of an online entry, the e-mail
            address used. The “primary account holder” is the natural person listed as the primary owner of the mobile device and associated mobile telephone
            number by a mobile telephone carrier, or the natural person assigned an e-mail address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other
            organization responsible for assigning e-mail addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. The potential winner may be required to
            show proof of being the primary account holder and/or e-mail address holder.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the event that a household plays the Game using more than five (5) unique e-mail addresses, all of the Game Plays associated with that household
            (determined by Sponsors or Administrator in their sole discretion) may be disqualified. Regardless of method of entry, each entrant/household is not
            eligible to win more than one (1) prize.
